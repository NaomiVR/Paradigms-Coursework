# Paradigms-Coursework
Year 1 Term 1 - 2 Coursework




This is a repo of my year 1 term 1 through 2 paradigms of programming coursework

It is a mini non-gui application to analyse and read a form of social network stored inside of a .txt file



The repo contains both the source code and a compiled main.exe found under executable/dist/
Running the raw source code the user may encounter a few minor visual errors if it's not run in a command line.
These issues are not present in the .exe version.
